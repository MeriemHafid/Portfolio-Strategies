# Portfolio-Strategies
This project compares the performance of three different portfolio strategies for the top 10 SBF 120 stocks in 2019. The strategies include an equally-weighted portfolio, a Markowitz minimum-variance portfolio, and an Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) portfolio. The analysis assesses their performance in terms of Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown, plotting their PnL trajectories with an initial wealth of 1 million euros in the final cell of the notebook.
